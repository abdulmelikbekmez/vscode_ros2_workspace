# VSCode ROS2 Workspace Template

This template will get you set up using ROS2 with VSCode as your IDE.

See [how I develop with vscode and ros2](https://www.allisonthackston.com/articles/vscode_docker_ros2.html) for a more in-depth look on how to use this workspace.

## Features

### Style

ROS2-approved formatters are included in the IDE.  

* **python** autopep8; vscode settings consistent with the [style guide](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Contributing/Code-Style-Language-Versions/)

### Tasks

There are many pre-defined tasks, see [`.vscode/tasks.json`](.vscode/tasks.json) for a complete listing.  Feel free to adjust them to suit your needs.  

Take a look at [how I develop using tasks](https://www.allisonthackston.com/articles/vscode_tasks.html) for an idea on how I use tasks in my development.

### Debugging

This template sets up debugging for python files and gdb for cpp programs.  See [`.vscode/launch.json`](.vscode/launch.json) for configuration details.
